> 🚀 **Financial Performance Dashboard** :

This Power BI dashboard provides a visual analysis of key financial metrics such as revenue, expenses, and profit over time. It helps track financial performance and supports better business decision-making through interactive and data-driven insights.

📝**Description/Purpose** :

The purpose of this project is to visualize and analyze financial data using Power BI, enabling users to monitor revenue, expenses, profit margins, and cash flow trends over time. The dashboard supports dynamic filtering and drill-through analysis to help stakeholders make informed financial decisions.

🧰**Tech Stack** :

• Power BI Desktop – for data visualization and dashboard creation

• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for calculated measures and KPIs

• Power Query Editor – for data transformation and cleaning
 
• Excel / CSV – as the data source (if applicable)

• Data Modeling – for building relationships and creating efficient data schema

📌**Feature and Highlights**

• **Goal** :
To create a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard that enables users to monitor and analyze financial performance metrics—such as revenue, expenses, and profit—in order to support data-driven business decisions. 

• **Walkthrough on Key Visuals** :

**KPI Cards**: Display top-level metrics such as Total Revenue, Total Expenses, and Net Profit for quick performance snapshots.

**Line Charts**: Show trends over time for revenue, expenses, and profit, helping to identify seasonal or monthly fluctuations.

**Bar Charts**: Compare financial performance across categories such as departments, regions, or time periods.

**Pie/Donut Charts** (if used): Visualize the composition of expenses or revenue by category for easy proportion analysis.
