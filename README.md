> 🚀 Financial Performance Dashboard :

This Power BI dashboard provides a visual analysis of key financial metrics such as revenue, expenses, and profit over time. It helps track financial performance and supports better business decision-making through interactive and data-driven insights.

📝Description/Purpose :

The purpose of this project is to visualize and analyze financial data using Power BI, enabling users to monitor revenue, expenses, profit margins, and cash flow trends over time. The dashboard supports dynamic filtering and drill-through analysis to help stakeholders make informed financial decisions.

🧰Tech Stack :

• Power BI Desktop – for data visualization and dashboard creation

• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for calculated measures and KPIs

• Power Query Editor – for data transformation and cleaning
 
• Excel / CSV – as the data source (if applicable)

• Data Modeling – for building relationships and creating efficient data schema

📌Feature and Highlights

• Goal :
To create a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard that enables users to monitor and analyze financial performance metrics—such as revenue, expenses, and profit—in order to support data-driven business decisions. 

• Walkthrough on Key Visuals :

**KPI Cards**: Display top-level metrics such as Total Revenue, Total Expenses, and Net Profit for quick performance snapshots.

**Line Charts**: Show trends over time for revenue, expenses, and profit, helping to identify seasonal or monthly fluctuations.

**Bar Charts**: Compare financial performance across categories such as departments, regions, or time periods.

**Pie/Donut Charts** (if used): Visualize the composition of expenses or revenue by category for easy proportion analysis.

**Slicers & Filters**: Enable dynamic selection by month, quarter, department, or region to customize the view and analysis.

**Drillthrough Pages**: Allow users to click on a category and explore more detailed financial breakdowns for better insights.

🗂️Data Source :

The dataset used in this project was provided by my institution as part of a Power BI assignment. It contains structured financial data including revenue, expenses, profit, and related attributes over time. The data was used solely for academic and learning purposes.

🏁How to Run the Project:

• Download the dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

• Import the CSV files (`CovidDeaths.csv`, `CovidVaccinations.csv`) ito your SQL Server / MySQL.

• Run the SQL scripts in the provided `.sql` file.

📈Lessons Learned: 

Working on this project gave me hands-on experience in exploring and analyzing real-world data using SQL. I deepened my understanding of SQL fundamentals such as filtering, grouping, and joining multiple datasets, and advanced my skills by using concepts like Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions (SUM() OVER()), and temporary tables to handle complex analytical tasks. I also learned how to calculate key performance metrics such as infection rates, case fatality rates, and vaccination progress across countries and continents. Structuring queries to produce clean, analysis-ready data helped me see the importance of data preparation for visualization and reporting purposes. This project taught me not just how to write SQL code, but how to think like a data analyst—focusing on trends, patterns, and extracting meaningful insights from data that can support real-world decision-making.
